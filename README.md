<!-- About the Project -->
## :star2: Problem Statement
Many social programs have a hard time making sure the right people are given enough aid. It's tricky when a program focuses on the poorest segment of the population. This segment of population can't provide the necessary income and expense records to prove that they qualify.
### üßê Proposed solution
In Latin America, a popular method called Proxy Means Test (PMT) uses an algorithm to verify income qualification. With PMT, agencies use a model that considers a family's observable household attributes like the material of their walls and ceiling or the assets found in their homes to classify them and predict their level of need. While this is an improvement, accuracy remains a problem as the regions population grows and poverty declines.

The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) believes that new methods beyond traditional econometrics, based on a dataset of Costa Rican household characteristics, might help improve PMT's performance.

### üßê Bias in machine learning datasets
When collecting data to build a training set for Machine Learning solutions, it is important to understand the breadth and depth of the data available to you.
In the Duke-Margolis research, they call out that ‚Äú...there are geographic biases to much of the data used to train AI. If the tools being built are deployed in more rural or varied regional populations, the representation of the data may not overlay in the same way and can lead to unexpected outcomes based on the machine learning biased data sets.
The population structure of the source data can be also weighted based on who is included or excluded.

Missing Feature Values
If your data set has one or more features that have missing values for a large number of examples, that could be an indicator that certain key characteristics of your data set are under-represented.

### ‚úÖ:gem: Some suggestions to address bias
Question the preconceptions: A machine learning model learns from historical decisions and their intent, where the intent is known. At every stage of training data preparation, it is important to question where the data is coming from, whose perceptions affected earlier decisions, and what changes need to be made in the data accordingly to clean it for training purposes.

Continuous development / testing:
An algorithm that works for one set of data will not likely work with an extended version of the same data. It might if we keep testing the system with challenger models and verify its predictive accuracy, transparency, and improvement rate.
